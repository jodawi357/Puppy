    <h1>How to Pick Out a Puppy</h1>
    <br />
    <p>Here I will be instructing you on how to pick out your own puppy. It's really simple, but I have prepared a list of things to look for to make it easier</p>
    <br />
    <ul>
        <li>The first thing to know is that they come in many colors, including black and brown and white.</li>
        <li>They typically have 4 legs, but some have been known to have fewer, but not often more.</li>
        <li>They also usually have 2 eyes and 2 ears towards the tops of their heads, but, again, this is not a hard rule.</li>
        <li>Probably most noticablke of all is the tale at the back end. You'll notice that on a happy puppy, it never stops moving.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>These are just a few traits to help you identify a proper puppy, but they're not the only ones to look for.</p>
